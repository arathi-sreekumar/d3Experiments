# d3Experiments
Trying out several d3 libraries

This is just a rapid prototype developed for demo purposes. I have created a version of it based on the nutrients database used for parallel coordinates.

The parallel coordinates code is used from https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/ 

I have mainly used a browser sqlLite database to show how this can be used to manipulate and visualise the available data through live filtering.

To see this code in action, simply clone this repository and start up a simple web server.

You may need to set up a local server running, my preferred method is python's simpleHTTPServer.

Please note that this would only work on browsers supporting SqlLite (Chrome, Safari Opera). See here: http://caniuse.com/#feat=sql-storage.

Have fun and any feedbacks are welcome.
